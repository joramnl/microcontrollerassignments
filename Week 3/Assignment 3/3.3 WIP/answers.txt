ADC

1. Which pins on the Nucleo F303RE can be used to read analog values?
2. As soon as the ‘adc’ pins is read, what is the minimum and maximum voltage that will be measured?
3. How many bits does the ADC of the Nucleo F303RE have? Check the datasheet!
4. Which value corresponds to the minimum voltage and which value corresponds to the maximum voltage of the ‘adc’ pins?

Thermistor

1. What is the resistance of the thermistor at 25 degrees Celsius?
	according to adafruite the Thermistor has a resistance of 1kΩ ±1% when at 25°C
2. Which reference resistor are you going to use (multiple answers possible)?
	
3. Draw your circuit using Fritzing.
